                    <p>So I am born and raised in Las Vegas Nevada, a 'Battle Born' child. I attended two High Schools here in Las Vegas, which were Shadow Ridge 9th thru 11th grade and Arbor View High school my senior year. I was a highly recurited student to play defense, but I lost my scholorships due to having shoulder surgery.<a href='https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/maple/147264'>Football</a> was just a sport I was really good at but Baseball was my First Love. But, I lost that dream because of my shoulders.</p>
                    <p>I did served in the U.S. Army, and was released back in 2010. I have been going from job to job for many years now and have not found anything I am passionate about yet. I have started too teach myself how to code because I love to solve hard problems and stand up too difficult situations. Coding has been very interesting so far because I have watched many hours of youtube videos and filtering through peoples point of views on how to code and put together what works best for me. My little brother just got out of the Air Force doing Cyber Security and he loves it. So maybe one day we can work together and start our own business working on computers.</p>
