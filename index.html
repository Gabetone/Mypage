                    <h2>Home Page</h2>
                <p>Welcome to My first webpage, I am very proud of my page because I taught my self.</p>
                <p>Video games has been my favorite hobby for many years, MLB The Show is my favorite game and than there is the FallOuts. My favorite console is the PlayStation 4 and I will soon be getting PlayStation 5. I love to be out doors and go fishing and hiking and also camping. In the near future I would like to put my coding skills together and start also working with programming Drones. I want to put a drone together from scratch. The best part about Las Vegas now is that we have two Professional sport teams, the Las Vegas <a Href='https://www.raiders.com/'>Raiders</a> and the <a href='https://www.nhl.com/goldenknights'>Golden Knights</a>. With Covid, no one can attend the Raider games but I have seen the inside of the stadium and it is beautiful, but I have been to a couple of Knights games and they were off the chain.</p>
                <p>Feel free to navigate through my website and give some feedback, with this being my first page. I plan to keep making more and include better looking website.</p>
